<h1>Meet Jack</h1>
<img src="./petImages/img4.PNG" alt="Jack">

<p >
    This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an
    empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but
    he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few
    things in the box.
</p>
    

<p>Jack would really like...

<ul>
    <li>Roller blades</li>
    <li>Magic tricks</li>
    <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
    <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
</ul> </p>

<p>

You can get all this (and more) at an online toy
store. Two very popular ones are <a href="http://toysrus" target="_blank" >toysrus.com</a> and
<a href="http://eToys.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>eToys.
